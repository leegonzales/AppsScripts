#GPTPromptCompletion

GPTPromptCompletion is a JavaScript function that makes an API request to OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to complete a prompt. The function takes in four parameters: prompt (the prompt to be completed), input (additional input to the prompt), temperature (sampling temperature of the model), and maxTokens (maximum number of tokens to generate).
Getting Started

    Obtain an API key for OpenAI's GPT-3 API.
    Update the OPENAI_API_KEY constant with your API key.
    (Optional) Update the GPT_MODEL and GPT_TEMP constants with the desired model and temperature, respectively.
    Call the GPTPromptCompletion function with the desired parameters.

##Function Details

The function sends the API request using the UrlFetchApp.fetch method and implements error handling and retrying for failed requests with a maximum of 5 attempts and exponential backoff. The function returns the completed prompt as a string, or an error message if the request fails after 5 attempts or if the response from the API is invalid.
##Example Usage
'''
const completedPrompt = GPTPromptCompletion("What is the meaning of life?", "", 0.5, "text-davinci-002", 100);
console.log(completedPrompt);
'''

##Error Handling

The function includes error handling to catch any issues with the API response and returns a default error message if the response is invalid. The error message and any error messages from failed API requests will be logged to the console.
